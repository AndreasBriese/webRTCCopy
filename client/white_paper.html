Good news! WebRTC already mandates encryption over DTLS!<br />

<br />
Bad news: there is no authentication scheme. This website gets around that, not by requiring 3rd party authorization,<br />
but by negotiating an OTR encrypted tunnel between users. While this is potentially overkill, OTR does offer an added level of security.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
1) We use OTR's SMP in order to verify password both parties entered is the same<br />
2) Files are encrypted using RC4Drop with (the password negotiated during OTR setup + a random per-chunk nonce sent over from receiving end sent over OTR channel)<br />
3) Once files are received a hash is sent back to the other party over the OTR channel in order to verify file integrity<br />
